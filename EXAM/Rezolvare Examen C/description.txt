Description: What happened? When and where? Who else was involved? What did you do? What did other people do? What was the outcome?
Answer: We worked on the assignment as a team over 6 hours over the course of one day, starting on May 27th 2023. We collaborated remotely using as communication Tool Discord and shared our ideas regularly. During the assignment, we didn’t divide the tasks, but we worked concurrently together. We read together each task, discussing our ideas and how we would approach them until we made a common point. At different moments, each of us shared the screen and wrote code or wrote into the documentation file and we shared these resources among us. While one was writing, we others were searching, or we were reading the tasks, explaining them. When I think about the way we worked I realize it was effective. We managed to understand each other’s opinions, share our thoughts, and learn to work simultaneously much better, as a team. We all managed to increase our knowledge about testing and how to perform it, learning from each other.
